# Course Overview
The class addressed the segmentation of private networks, focusing on cybersecurity concepts and the importance of access control. One of the participants in the conference room started the discussion by sharing experiences with the Internet and a recent lecture, emphasizing the relevance of segmentation and the use of VLANs to optimize network security and performance. The need to isolate devices connected to the public Internet, especially in industrial environments, and the creation of a private government network to ensure secure communications were also highlighted.

Access control was a central point of the discussion, with one of the participants explaining how it can be based on IP addresses, MAC addresses and identity, allowing the implementation of more effective security policies. The class was complemented by a practical demonstration on the configuration of segmented networks and the importance of the Spanning Tree protocol to avoid communication failures. The class included connectivity tests between different VLANs, demonstrating the effectiveness of segmentation without the need for a router.

One of the participants also presented the RADIUS protocol as a solution for authentication in wireless networks, allowing each user to have an individual account. The importance of segmentation through VLANs to isolate sectors and reduce the spread of attacks was discussed, in addition to mentioning the use of technologies such as ACLs and proxies to manage traffic. The architecture of private networks was addressed, highlighting the fusion of public and private networks in 5G and the need for strict access control.

The practical class included the creation and activation of VLANs in Linux, with one of the participants demonstrating the assignment of IP addresses and clarifying doubts about communication between VLANs. The concept of NAT and the importance of DHCP in the configuration of internal networks were also introduced. The discussion ended with the promise to address the topic of 5G in the next class, including topics on RAN and signaling protocols in mobile networks.

* Use of RADIUS protocol for wireless network authentication.

### Architecture of Private Networks and Segmentation
Presented core concepts of private network architecture, including merging public and private networks in 5G. Detailed segmentation using VLANs, IP, and identity. Highlighted access control, best practices like device authentication, and continuous monitoring.
* Security practices including Zero Trust and authentication.

### VLAN Configuration on Linux
VLAN creation using ENS33 interface in Linux was demonstrated. IP addresses were assigned to TI and engineering VLANs, both marked as "Up." It was clarified that Linux allows VLAN communication by default, unlike switches.

### Private Networks and High Availability
NAT usage for multiple internal devices sharing one IP was discussed. DHCP’s role in automatic IP, subnet, gateway, and DNS configuration was also covered.
* Network modes in virtualization (Bridge, NAT, Host Only).
* Network segmentation and applications.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Key Questions
> * How can the RADIUS protocol be used for authentication in wireless networks?
> * Is it possible to have more than one VLAN on the same port?
> * How important is network segmentation in corporate environments?
> * What are the best practices for network authentication?
> * Why did Gabriel create a VLAN for these unused ports and then turn it off?
> * How can security be guaranteed in a network with multiple VLANs?
