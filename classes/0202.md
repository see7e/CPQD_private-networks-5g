# Course Overview
The cybersecurity discussion addressed the importance of Linux and the need for a comprehensive understanding of cyberattacks, highlighting recent events that may have been the cause of such attacks. Professor Almir mentioned that Brazil is one of the most attacked countries, due to its high connectivity and low maturity in information security. The class focused on the anatomy of a cyberattack, from detection to mitigation, with supporting materials available on Discord for students.

The fundamental pillars of information security were discussed, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability, with examples of incidents that highlight the need for a rapid response to security issues. A participant in the conference room detailed the phases of a cyberattack, emphasizing the importance of understanding attackersâ€™ tactics and using security tools, such as SIEM, to monitor events. Suggestions were made to limit access to vulnerable ports, such as port 22, using tools such as Fail2Ban.

The complexity of responding to cyber incidents was addressed, highlighting the need for senior management involvement and cross-team collaboration. A panelist described a response process that includes preparedness, detection, containment, and forensics, aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Social engineering and phishing were also discussed, presenting a case in which a phishing test had alarming results at a large technology company, highlighting the need for cybersecurity training.

The discussion also included practical experiences, such as replicating environments in the cloud and the importance of security in this context. The panelist encouraged students to provide feedback and participate in Cisco courses, which offer certification and updated material. Positive comments about the class were made, and the discussion extended to topics such as synchronization networks and the use of NTP to ensure accurate synchronization. The class concluded with the expectation of a new session focused on telecommunications.

## Chapters & Topics
### Anatomy of a Cyber Attack
This session introduced the structure of a cyber attack and stressed the criticality of early detection, investigation, and response. The importance of Linux as a foundational tool for understanding OS behavior and cybersecurity was highlighted. Brazil was noted as highly vulnerable to cyber threats due to its low cybersecurity maturity.
* Best practices in cybersecurity
* Tools and defensive strategies
* Real-world cyber attack examples

### Security Incidents and Their Impact
Core information security principlesâ€”Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)â€”were discussed using practical examples. Case studies such as the Moovit platform breach (affecting 2,600 companies) and the UK Electoral Commission breach underscored the need for secure server configurations.
* Practical implications of CIA triad
* Analysis of high-profile security incidents

### Cyber Attack Analysis and Response Frameworks
Lockheed Martinâ€™s development of the Cyber Kill Chain was discussed, based on analysis of over 1,000 attacks. The MITRE ATT\&CK matrix, organizing attack behavior into 14 tactics, was introduced as a comprehensive tool to map the lifecycle of cyber attacks and create response playbooks.
* Cyber Kill Chain methodology
* MITRE ATT\&CK framework and its role in playbook creation

### Network Monitoring and Security Tools
Monitoring solutions like IBM CIEM and Zabbix were introduced. CIEM offers granular security event details, while Zabbix provides basic yet valuable insights into network issues like service outages.
* Usage of Zabbix and CIEM in incident detection
* Importance of monitoring in connected ecosystems

### Case Study: Data Exfiltration Attack
A targeted attack on a user named John was analyzed. The attacker transferred personal data to a temporary location without disrupting the server, demonstrating how some attackers prioritize data leaks over service disruption.
* Attack goals: data exfiltration vs. service interruption

### Cybersecurity Incident Response
A six-step incident response processâ€”Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learnedâ€”was presented. The role of executive leadership in decision-making during incidents was emphasized.
* Structured response to cyber attacks
* Post-incident knowledge sharing

### Mitigation and Response Measures
Live response techniques such as disabling scheduled tasks, blocking IPs in firewalls, and changing compromised credentials were discussed. The value of documenting mitigation activities for future use was reinforced.
* Containment and mitigation strategies
* Importance of action logging for audits

### Social Engineering and Phishing Awareness
A phishing test in a tech company revealed alarming user susceptibility: 32% clicked a malicious email and 15% submitted sensitive data. Even the CIO participated, revealing a pressing need for employee awareness training.
* Employee training on phishing threats
* Role of social engineering in modern attacks

### Recovery Planning and Cloud Security
Discussion covered AWS security tools and best practices like setting up failover structures in different AWS regions. The emphasis was on resilience and disaster recovery in cloud environments.
* Secure cloud architecture
* Cloud-native disaster recovery strategies

### Private Networks | Group 1
Students were encouraged to provide feedback, and Cisco course links were shared. These resources cover hardware fundamentals, basic networking, and network security. Enrollment deadline: **December 31**.
* Supplemental training with Cisco Networking Academy
* Student engagement through feedback

### Cybersecurity Class Feedback
Participants praised the relevance and clarity of the session. Ashley connected the content to her project management interests, while Clodoaldo was eager to apply what he learned but unsure of his ability to replicate the lessons independently.
* Positive reception and practical curiosity
* Need for guided repetition of content

### GPS Vulnerabilities and Network Sync
Discussions on moving from GPS to network-based synchronization due to GPS vulnerabilities were held. Microchipâ€™s insights and the utility of NTP (Network Time Protocol) for secure, accurate synchronization were presented.
* Network sync as a secure alternative to GPS
* Criticality of time accuracy in network security


> [!NOTE]
> ### Key Questions
> * Are the discounts only for postgraduate courses or also for CCyber â€‹â€‹preparatory courses?
> * What are the roles and responsibilities during a cyber attack?
> * What is a takedown and how does it relate to cybersecurity?
> * What are the best practices for mitigating cyber attacks?
> * How can mitigation be applied in a cyber attack?
> * How can a company train its employees to avoid phishing attacks?
