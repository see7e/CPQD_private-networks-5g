# Course Overview
This class covered the growing relevance of the subject in the marketâ€”especially in industryâ€”amid a wave ofÂ telecom transformation driven by [5G](mobile-networking-glossary.md#5) and other emerging technologies.
**EduardoÂ Moreno** explained how connectivity can boost GDP and why new service providers are appearing in Brazil to fill gaps left by the big carriers.
The class also weighed the tradeâ€‘off between privacy and customisation that private networks offer, positioning them as a new business model.

## Chapters & Topics

### Overall Context
Made an analysis about the importance of the `*G` communications and the related technologies such as Artificial Intelligence an Cloud-based Networks, [SDN](../../../Docs/sdn.md), [NFV](../../../Docs/nfv.md), etc.
Also was discussed the impact of high demand over the implementation of modern technologies by the newest members of market shares company owners.

### Basic Concepts

- "**MNO**": Mobile Network Operators;
- "**MVNO**": Mobile Virtual Network Operators;
- "**ISP**": Internet Service Providers;
- "**SMP spectrum**": Reffers to the spectrum of frequencies used for mobile telephony in Brazil, which is regulated by Anatel;
- "**Cells**": Caracterized by the distribution of the frequency zones around the Radio Base Stations;
- "**Coverage Planning**": Lower frequency spectrums are more adequate for higher coverage, while higher frequency spectrums are more suitable for data transmissions. Also involves the coverage prediction (altimetric and morphological calculations, equipment placement, etc.) and the propagation study;
- "**Propagation**": Relation between the distance from the Radio Base station and the quality degradation of the signal, which affects the downsize of the data transmissions to the end user;
- "**Propagation Map**": Is the map that shows the coverage of the radio signal in a given area, taking into account the terrain and other obstacles;
- "**Downlink x Uplink**": 
  - **Downlink**: The transmission from the base station to the terminal;
  - **Uplink**: The transmission from the terminal to the base station;
- "**Signal Degradation Adaptation**": 
  - **Signal Degradation**: The signal degradation is the loss of quality of the signal as it travels through the air and encounters obstacles;
  - **Adaptation**: The adaptation is the process of adjusting the transmission parameters to compensate for the signal degradation, such as increasing the power of the transmission or using error correction techniques.
  - **MCS**: Mobile Code Scheme, which is a method of adapting the transmission parameters to the channel conditions. Different schemes allows different data transmission taxes, depending on the channel conditions. The system adjust itself to the best MCS available, on a "hostile" environment;
- "**Network Slicing**": A method of creating multiple virtual networks on a single physical network infrastructure, allowing for different services to be delivered over the same network. This is particularly useful for private networks, as it allows for customisation and flexibility in service delivery;

### Technological Evolution
From *AMPS* to *5G* (1G > 2G > 3G(CDMA) > 4G(OFDMA) > 5G), there have been significant improvements in terms of capacity and security. He mentioned the transition from analog to digital systems and the increasing complexity of technologies, such as the use of different multiple access methods.

### Market
He addressed the dynamics of the telecommunications market, highlighting Vivo's leadership and the participation of Claro and Tim. The sale of Oi to other operators and the entry of new companies, such as Brizanet and Algar, were mentioned as factors that increase competition. He also highlighted the importance of private networks and the need for regulation to foster competition.
Other important mentions were:
- the demand for capacity (of a bigger user base and for better quality),
- the solution of issues inherited from past generations,
- newer spectifications emmited from regulators (national and international),
- incorporation of latest technologies (fiber, cable/HFC, xDSL, VSAT, ...) by the service providers,
- development of new business models and the creation of new lines of services (SMP, SCM, MTC).

### 5G
- Aerial Interface: 
  - The 5G system introduces a diversity of aerial interfaces, unlike previous generations that had a defined interface;
  - The development of 5G involved collaboration from major market players, such as Ericsson, Huawei, ZTE, and Samsung, and is considered a matter of time for successful implementation.

## Recommended Next Steps ðŸš€
1. **Confirm Spectrum Strategy**
    - Map onâ€‘site RF conditions; run a propagation study comparing 1.7Â GHz, CBRS (3.5Â GHz) and 26Â GHz mmWave to decide the best mix for coverageÂ Ã—Â capacity.
2. **Pilot a 5Â G Standâ€‘Alone (SA) Private Core**
    - Deploy a smallâ€‘scale SA core (openâ€‘source or vendor) to test URLLC and slicing features before scaling campusâ€‘wide.
3. **Establish Governance & Security Policies**
    - Define dataâ€‘sovereignty, QoS and cybersecurity requirements early, aligning OT and IT teams under ISA/IECÂ 62443 guidelines.
4. **Engage Regulators & OEM Ecosystem**
    - Request temporary spectrum trials from Anatel; engage device/OEM partners to certify radios in the chosen bands.
5. **Develop Businessâ€‘Value Metrics**
    - Track KPI improvements (OEE, latencyâ€‘sensitive process uptime) to build a business case linking privateâ€‘network spend to productivity gains.
6. **Plan for Infrastructure Sharing**
    - Evaluate neutralâ€‘host or multiâ€‘operator coreâ€‘sharing models to reduce capex and accelerate ROI, especially at greenâ€‘field industrial parks.
