# Course Overview
The discussion on private networks covered several technical and practical aspects, with a focus on *segmentation* and its advantages. **Loreno** explained that segmentation is *crucial to the structure of networks*, providing benefits such as cost reduction and security in communications. He used the example of a *PABX* to illustrate how segmentation can be more economical than installing separate lines. The importance of leveling knowledge about the *ISO model* and techniques such as *VLAN* and *VRF* was also emphasized.

Loreno detailed the structure of local and metropolitan networks, in addition to discussing technologies such as *VoIP* and 4G/5G. Ícaro raised questions about *encryption with tokens*, while Clodoaldo mentioned the relevance of *ATM and H323 networks*. Carlos Batista brought up the application of private networks in less favored areas, leading Loreno to discuss the implications of security and necessary authorization. The conversation also included the evolution of the internet and the importance of the OSI model for communication between different systems.

The presentation ended with an explanation of *DHCP* and *DNS*, in addition to the concept of the Internet of Things (*IoT*). Loreno highlighted segmentation as a way to optimize traffic and ensure privacy, while Gabryel asked about *protocol regulation*. Loreno confirmed the existence of open source options for some protocols. The discussion on segmentation techniques, such as the logical configuration of VLAN's, was in-depth, highlighting the importance of security and efficiency in corporate and educational environments.
