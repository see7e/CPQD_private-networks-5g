# Course Overview
The meeting addressed the configuration of private networks, focusing on the importance of planning and *segmenting traffic* through VLANs. Loreno stressed the need for a clear objective before starting the process, suggesting that *mapping network needs* should include the participation of stakeholders, such as technicians and telecommunications managers. The discussion also emphasized the *separation of traffic*, as well as the *identification of critical devices* and the analysis of the legacy network to meet project requirements.

Loreno presented useful tools for configuring networks, such as *Cisco Packet Tracer* and the *Huawei simulator*, and promised to provide additional material on the use of these tools. Although he opted for a theoretical approach due to time constraints, he considered the possibility of introducing a more practical course in the future. The conversation also addressed aspects such as the *amount of equipment*, *topology* and *technological preferences* of the client, as well as the categorization of equipment and the creation of different *types of VLANs*.

The issue of using 5G in telemedicine, especially for telesurgery, was raised, with Loreno explaining that automation in healthcare should be driven by hospitals. The importance of telesurgery in optimizing doctors‚Äô time was highlighted. The discussion also emphasized the need to isolate different types of traffic, such as voice, video, data, and IoT, to improve *network performance and security*, with suggestions that each segment have its own VLAN. Loreno discussed *best practices for VLAN management*, such as *avoiding associating VLANs with specific ports* and the importance of *disabling unused ports*. He also addressed *switch configuration*, *port assignment to VLANs*, and the need to monitor network performance. The *structure of IP addresses* and *network classes* were explained, preparing the group for future discussions on network configuration and planning. The meeting concluded with the promise that the next class would cover private cellular networks and VLANs.

## Chapters & Topics
### Planning and Configuration of VLANs
Loreno explained that planning is the most crucial phase when configuring VLANs, recommending that the process start with mapping network requirements. He emphasized talking to stakeholders to understand project goals and the existing infrastructure. The class will also cover traffic separation and how to anticipate future expansion.  
* Mapping network needs and identifying stakeholders  
* Analysing communication protocols and their practical applications  

### Private Networks | Class 1
Loreno stresses the need for an appropriate design for network configuration, noting that it is fundamental to a project‚Äôs success. √çcaro shows interest in coursework on network design, and Loreno offers to share concise material on the topic. He mentions Cisco Packet Tracer as a possible tool but opts for a more theoretical approach because of the limited time available.  

### Discussion on Network Topology and Equipment
Loreno highlights the relevance of knowing the network topology and the technological alternatives the client may consider, such as 4G or 5G. He underlines the importance of discussing financial capacity, future growth plans, security, and data-integration issues.  

### Discussion on IoT and 5G Networks
√çcaro asks about the efficiency of 4G and 5G for IoT and notes the difficulty of finding courses on private 5G networks. Loreno confirms the scarcity of such courses and points out that FIAP‚Äôs initiative is unprecedented.  
* Differences between 4G and 5G in IoT efficiency  
* Security requirements for 5G networks and IoT  

### Private Networks and VLAN Configuration
Loreno details the network configuration, mentioning the interconnection between administrative and operational sectors. Antonildo proposes using separate switches for different VLANs to optimise traffic. The discussion also covers prioritising voice traffic and securing data, especially with IoT in mind.  

### Redundancy Analysis in Private Networks
During the discussion, Carlos Batista raises concerns about network reliability, especially regarding VLANs and switches. Loreno clarifies that, with proper configuration, the network can remain operational if a single switch fails, but multiple component failures would cause a total outage. Clodoaldo adds that switch reliability is a key factor.  

### Private Networks | Class 1 (continued)
Loreno elaborates on the importance of network segmentation, stressing that different traffic types‚Äîsuch as voice and IoT‚Äîshould not share the same subnet. He also mentions the need for IP-address planning and configuring switches to manage VLANs. Antonio suggests connecting to the cloud for secure communication.  

### VLAN Security and Management
Loreno explains that SSH provides a secure remote connection, enabling device management through the command line. He recommends configuring switch ports so that traffic matches the assigned VLANs and suggests creating ‚Äúblack-hole‚Äù VLANs for unused ports to enhance security.  
* Structure and configuration of VLANs for different traffic types  
* Importance of thorough planning in VLAN configuration  

### Binary Representation and IP Addressing
Loreno reviews how binary numbers relate to IP addressing and emphasises counting in powers of two, while Clodoaldo corrects a point about number positions.  

### Network Classes and Subnetting**  
Loreno explains that Class A networks have fewer networks with more hosts, Class B offers more balance, and Class C provides more networks but fewer addresses per network. He also introduces subnetting, which divides a network into smaller segments to simplify addressing.  

### Private Networks and VLANs (Layer-3 Switches)
Clodoaldo asks Loreno to define a layer-3 switch and its practical operation. Loreno responds that a layer-2 switch forwards traffic within the same network, whereas a layer-3 switch is required to route data between networks. Clodoaldo mentions visiting CPQD to better understand these concepts in practice.  
* Definition and operation of layer-3 switches  
* Practical examples of routing and inter-network communication  
* Discussion about needing extra material to resolve doubts  

> [!NOTE]
> ### Key Questions
> - Why is planning so important for configuring VLANs?
> - Is 4G or 5G recommended for IoT efficiency?
> - How can Clodoaldo Callogero visualise a layer-3 switch in practice?
> - What basic doubts does Clodoaldo Callogero have about layer-3 switches?
