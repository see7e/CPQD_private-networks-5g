# Course Overview
The class focused on integrating knowledge about VLANs with private networks, addressing the requirements for configuring 4G and 5G networks. Loreno Menezes da Silveira highlighted the importance of *equipment compatibility with frequency bands* and the need for an *identity module in terminals*. He emphasized the functionality of VLANs for data segmentation and suggested practical exercises to better understand the topic. The discussion also included the relevance of Edge Computing and CloudRail in setting up private networks.

During the class, the challenges and costs associated with compliance with data protection laws, such as *LGPD* and *GDPR*, were discussed. Gabriel mentioned that cloud operations were crucial for success in a bid, while João highlighted the requirement for storing sensitive data in Brazil. The conversation addressed the importance of data security, especially in regulated sectors, and how familiarity with technologies can influence the choice of cloud platforms.

Loreno also presented concepts such as *centralized front hall* and *private network topology*, clarifying the connection between *EC2 instances* and the internet. The discussion included the use of AWS Snowball Edge for data transport in places without internet and the possibility of operating offline applications with the 5G network. He concluded the class by highlighting the importance of VLANs in the current context, especially with the growth of IoT and the implementation of 5G, and thanked the participants for their contributions.

## Chapters & Topics

### Considerations on VLANs in Private Networks
Loreno Menezes da Silveira opened the session by framing the role of VLANs within private 4G/5G networks. He outlined the class objectives: review 4G/5G network requirements, assemble private networks, and highlight the significance of Edge Computing and CloudRail. He also introduced private networks hosted in the cloud and set the stage for a deep dive into 5G protocols.
* Importance of Edge Computing and CloudRail
* Analysis of 5G network protocols

### Requirements and Structure of Private Networks
Loreno detailed the critical prerequisites for a private network, including equipment compatibility, an identity module for subscriber management, and a radio base station tied into both the network core and the public Internet. He specified a minimum throughput of 100 Mb/s for data traffic and explained how VLANs segment and prioritize different data types.
* VLAN configuration and assignment

### Private Networks | Class 1
In this first “Private Networks” module, Loreno introduced the concept of a centralized front hall, and demonstrated how microcells and picocells interface with the radio base station. He contrasted legacy 4G deployments with emerging 5G architectures and showcased Cloud Run as an optimized alternative for managing virtualized network functions.

### Private Networks and 5G
Loreno explained that private networks can be either fully or partially managed via cloud services, emphasizing the need for centralized orchestration and control. When Ícaro asked whether 5G deployment is simpler than 4G, Loreno confirmed that 5G’s design inherently streamlines the rollout of new network functions.
* Concept of centralized front hall and its relation to 5G

### Challenges and Costs of Cloud Data Storage
João raised concerns about Brazil’s LGPD mandate requiring national data residency, which can inflate storage costs. Gabriel illustrated this with the recent GDPR fine imposed on TikTok in the EU, underscoring the financial risks of non-compliance. He noted that repositioning data to Brazil after LGPD enforcement had significantly increased the company’s cloud expenses.

### Private Networks | Class 1 (continued)
Loreno reviewed the core functions of both 4G and 5G network cores—some of which may reside in the cloud. Gabriel questioned whether a single-cloud or multi-cloud approach is preferable; Antonio Carlos responded that team expertise and cost considerations should guide that decision.

### Discussion on AWS Snowball Edge
Loreno and Antonio discussed how Snowball Edge devices facilitate data collection in locations with limited connectivity. Snowball transports data back to AWS S3, where João Rubens noted that on-device processing can reduce the volume of data sent over the Internet.

### Private Networks and 5G Core
Antonio Adade described how a 5G core can connect to a private environment, enabling offline applications. He introduced AWS Outposts (“Outspot”) as on-premises hardware, and Gabriel Theodoro added that the latest Snowball models can process camera feeds locally without leaving the private network.

### Private Networks and Emerging Technologies
Loreno underscored that VLANs gain strategic importance as 5G and IoT converge, allowing precise segmentation and device isolation. He compared the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) with TCP, detailing SCTP’s advantages in reducing latency and improving throughput for real-time applications.
