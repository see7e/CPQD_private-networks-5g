# Course Overview
The class addressed the implementation of private networks, highlighting the analysis of the terrain and the selection of appropriate frequency bands. Loreno explained the different types of cells, such as macrocells and microcells, and their characteristics, including power and range. He also emphasized the importance of considering user density and the environment when deciding between cell types, in addition to presenting practical examples and discussing Anatel regulations related to the Mosaico system.

During the discussion, technical aspects of radio base installation were addressed, including environmental protection and supervision with safety devices. Clodoaldo asked about the interconnection between switches and radio bases, and Loreno confirmed the feasibility of wired and wireless solutions. Frequency allocation for private networks was detailed, with emphasis on the bands assigned by Anatel and the possibility of operating in multiple bands, depending on the antenna used. Infrastructure costs and regulatory requirements for the authorization of private limited services were also discussed.

The class concluded with an explanation of the Anatel registration process and the importance of following the guidelines for requesting authorizations. Loreno highlighted the need for a legal representative and the correct presentation of documents. The discussion included Anatel‚Äôs new resolution 775, with everyone agreeing to review the document to understand the changes. The importance of being up to date with regulations and fees associated with the use of radio frequencies was also emphasized.

## Chapters & Topics
### üì° Frequency Analysis and Cell Types
Loreno emphasized the importance of selecting appropriate frequency bands and conducting terrain analysis for private network installations. He detailed various cell types‚Äîmacrocells, microcells, and picocells‚Äîalong with their respective power levels and coverage ranges. The discussion included practical examples and the relationship between user density and the choice of suitable cell types.
*Key Point:* Types of cells and their characteristics.

### üîß Private Networks | Class 1
Loreno elaborated on the configuration of radio bases and the arrangement of switches, suggesting that the security network could share infrastructure with other networks. Clodoaldo raised the issue of interconnecting switches and radio bases, questioning whether the connection could be established via radio frequency.

Explained that in Brazil, 4G is limited to the 2,600 MHz and 700 MHz bands, while 5G can operate in broader bands such as 3.5 GHz and 26 GHz. He highlighted that to use 4G in the 3.5 GHz band, it must be explored as SLP (Private Limited Service), as it is not permitted for SMP (Personal Mobile Service).

The Temporary Spectrum Use Authorization, as discussed by Loreno, is an authorization that can be requested for events and visits, with a maximum term of 60 days. Icaro raised the issue of authorization revocation, and Loreno explained that if the frequency is maintained, a new application may be necessary. Daniel mentioned a new resolution, 775, which replaces the previous one.

### üì∂ Private Networks and Frequencies
Loreno explained that when opting for a private network, dedicated frequencies are preferable, while partnerships with SMP providers depend on the choice of the provider. He also cited examples of companies using specific frequency bands, such as Vale, which utilizes a dedicated band for its railway operations to avoid interference.

### üìú Telecommunications Service Regulation
Loreno noted that infrastructure constitutes the most significant cost in telecommunications services, while electronic components are treated separately. He presented Anatel's 1998 regulation, considered exemplary, and detailed the definition of restricted-interest telecommunications services, intended for private use and not subject to collective conditions.
*Key Point:* Regulations on telecommunications services.

### üì° Private Networks and Frequency Bands
Antonio Adade emphasized that Anatel designated the 3.7 GHz band for use in private networks and 5G. Loreno clarified that since 4G does not utilize this band, it is preferential for 5G. Clodoaldo inquired about the possibility of using macrocells in this band, and Loreno confirmed that, although uncommon, it is feasible.

### üìù Discussion on Regulation and Authorization of Private Network Services
Loreno detailed the definitions of private network usage, emphasizing that they can be intended for specific user groups and have various applications, including scientific data collection. He stressed that authorization for SMP exploitation does not involve bidding, allowing for a more straightforward authorization process.

### üîó Private Networks and Interconnections
Loreno detailed that private networks cannot interconnect with other networks, including the prohibition of contracting third-party services. Clodoaldo questioned interconnection with Claro, and Antonio proposed using network "slices" to circumvent this limitation. The discussion highlighted the need to follow Anatel's guidelines.
*Key Points:*
* Interconnection between private networks and SMP.
* Registration process in the Mosaico system.

### üìù Registration and Processes at Anatel
Loreno detailed the procedure for registration in Anatel's system, emphasizing that all parties involved in the applications must be registered. He also addressed the need for a lawyer as a legal representative and the importance of using the SEI system for registration. Additionally, he highlighted that the form must be submitted as a single PDF file.
